# Introduction to Plant Bioinformatics

# Course Description

Modern plant science is increasingly driven by massive genomic datasets. To bridge the gap between field observations and molecular understanding, this course provides a comprehensive foundation for researchers and students looking to master the digital tools of the trade.

Participants will learn to navigate the journey from **observable phenotypic traits to in-depth gene family characterization**. By leveraging high-throughput computational tools, you will gain the skills to identify candidate genes, analyze evolutionary relationships, and automate complex workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

* **Navigate Genomic Resources:** Utilize **Ensembl Plants** to mine genomic data, identify orthologs, and extract sequences for comparative analysis.
* **Execute Standardized Workflows:** Master the **Galaxy** platform for reproducible data analysis, enabling complex bioinformatics without requiring advanced programming skills.
* **Analyze Gene Families:** Perform phylogenetic reconstructions and structural analysis to understand the functional evolution of specific plant gene families.
* **Integrate AI & LLMs:** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to synthesize biological literature, troubleshoot analysis scripts, and interpret complex results.

## The "Traits-to-Genes" Integration

The course concludes with an **Integration Workshop** where participants select a specific plant trait and trace its genetic architecture. You will identify associated gene families across different species and build a unified analysis pipeline. This holistic approach ensures that you leave with a practical framework applicable to your own research.

## Course Modules

1. **Ensembl Plants:** Data mining, genome browsing, and comparative genomics.
2. **The Galaxy Ecosystem:** Mastering reproducible workflows.
3. **AI in Bioinformatics:** Prompt engineering for biology and AI-driven data synthesis.
4. **Capstone Integration:** Final project from trait discovery to gene family analysis.
