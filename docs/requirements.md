# Laptop Requirements

Modern plant bioinformatics is computationally intensive, but because this course utilizes cloud-based platforms like **Galaxy** and **Ensembl**, the heavy lifting is handled by remote servers. However, a capable local machine is still required to manage multiple browser tabs, data visualization tools, and AI assistants simultaneously.

## Hardware Specifications

| Component | Minimum Requirement | Recommended |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Processor (CPU)** | Intel Core i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 | Intel Core i7 / Apple M1 or better |
| **Memory (RAM)** | 8 GB | **16 GB** |
| **Storage** | 20 GB free space | 50 GB+ (SSD preferred) |
| **Display** | 13" Screen (1366x768) | 15" Screen (1920x1080) |

## Connectivity & Software

* **Internet Stability:** A stable connection is the most critical requirement.
    * *Minimum:* 5 Mbps
    * *Recommended:* 20+ Mbps (for smooth genomic track rendering).
* **Web Browser:** **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** (Latest versions).
    * *Note:* Avoid using Safari or Internet Explorer/Edge, as they can experience compatibility issues with specific Galaxy tool wrappers.
* **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS (Ventura+), or any modern Linux distribution.

## Why we recommend 16GB of RAM
Bioinformatics workflows often require "multi-tasking" across several high-resource applications. A typical session in this course might involve:
1.  **Ensembl Plants** running interactive genome browser tracks.
2.  **Galaxy** performing data integration in another tab.
3.  **AI Assistants** (Gemini/ChatGPT) providing coding or interpretation support.
4.  **Local Visualization** software (like IGV or MEGA) running in the background.

Machines with only 8GB of RAM may experience significant "lag" or browser crashes when handling these concurrent tasks.

> ### ⚠️ A Note on Tablets
> While you can view course materials on an iPad or Android tablet, a **physical keyboard and mouse/trackpad are required** to complete the hands-on exercises effectively. Mobile interfaces are not currently optimized for complex genomic browser navigation.
